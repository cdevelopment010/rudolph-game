# Rudolph Game - Codemas 2022 challenge #3

The idea this week was themed around rudolph, but to be as creative as possible. 

One thing that I want to work on is building little games, so I thought this would be a good experiment to try out. 

The game will consist of rudolph along the bottom, and will move using the arrow keys (not sure if I will have time to make it work on touch). Rudolph will catch the presents that fall.
